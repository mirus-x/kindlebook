##First training course from LBTA bootcamp

This project completely covers LBTA basic **Swift** learning BootCamp with implementation of new styles and coding teqniques for **Swift 4.2+** .

I have to addmit, this course is not for complete beginners in swift, but for those who already familiar with syntax and basic understanding of MVC pattern.

This project **is completely getting no storyboard approach** everything is created programmatically, which brought you to the next level of confidency and understanding, how IOS or OSX programs works.
